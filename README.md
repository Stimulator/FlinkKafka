The following project depicts upon two following strategies:

1.) Kafka Producer to Kafka Consumer. (locally)
2.) FlinkKafka Producer to FlinkKafkaConsumer (locally) -> You will have to pass the program argument from your IntelliJ for both.

The Data set I have used is simple POJO type. Which serialises and deserialises the data from Producer to Consumer.
This is just an example and reference to how can we perform this easily. Do check the pom.xml for dependencies or clone the project.

PreRequesites :

1.) Maven 3.0x+
2.) IntelliJ with Kafka and Kafka-Flink Maven dependencies.
3.) Kafka local setup

Currently learning it so it has been made for learning use.
Thanks
